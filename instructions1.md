# Eosc326DE, Lab 1, sketches 1 & 2
WHILE completing the question set, USE the two little sketch annotation apps below to indicate age ranges for fossils and "sp" specimens.

## Here are instructions for sketch 1:
**NOTE 1** - The figures may contain some previous sketch marks. This is normal. Simply refresh the page to start with a fresh background canvas.

**NOTE 2** - You MAY want to stop working before completing questions and sketches. These two sketches will NOT be saved properly. THEREFORE you are encouraged to keep a copy of your work (using the Save as PNG button) so that when you start again, you can first "clear", then re-draw the age-ranges quickly.


 
 * Press on the text box to the bottom left region of the image to edit the text with **your name**. 
 * Use the "Draw line" button (in the toolbar on the top of the image) to **draw in your interpretations of age ranges** for the six remaining fossil types. 
 * Use the "color picker" to change the **color** you are working with, changes will apply to the last edited annotation (line).
 * Then **save result** by clicking the **camera icon** button (in toolbar). This will downlaod you image. 

 * PLEASE rename **this file using your name**: eg. "JaneDoe-sketch1.png". Do NOT change the "png" part. 

 * Finally, **upload your image** to this CONNECT site as requested in the Lab 1 steps that follow the "Questions to answer".
