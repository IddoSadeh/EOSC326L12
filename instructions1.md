# Eosc326DE, Lab 1, sketches 1 & 2
WHILE completing the question set, USE the two little sketch annotation apps below to indicate age ranges for fossils and "sp" specimens.

## Here are instructions for sketch 1:
**NOTE 1** - The figures may contain some previous sketch marks. This is normal. Simply use the "clear" button to start with a fresh background canvas.

**NOTE 2** - You MAY want to stop working before completing questions and sketches. If so, then the Connect "quiz" portion will save and allow restarting as usual. However, these two sketches will NOT be saved properly. THEREFORE you are encouraged to keep a copy of your work (using the Save as PNG button) so that when you start again, you can first "clear", then re-draw the age-ranges quickly.


 * To start, use the sketch app's "stroke" button (second from bottom of the tool bar) to chose a color. 
 * Use the "text" button to **add your name** to the bottom left blank region. 
 * Use the "stroke" button to **pick a second color.** 
 * Use the "line" button to **draw in your interpretations of age ranges** for the six remaining fossil types. 
 * Then **save result** as follows: 

 * Click "**Export as PNG**" button (under tools). This puts your result into a new browser tab. 
 * Use your **browser** to "Save as" or "Save Image As". 
 * PLEASE name **this file using your name**: eg. "JaneDoe-sketch1.png". Do NOT change the "png" part. 

 * Finally, **upload your image** to this CONNECT site as requested in the Lab 1 steps that follow the "Questions to answer".
