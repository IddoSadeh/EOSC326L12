## Instructions for sketch 2 are very similar:
<ol>
<li> Add **your name** to the bottom left blank region. </li>
<li> Use a different colour to draw lines for your **interpretations of age ranges** for specimens in the figure. </li>
<li> IN ADDITION - use a **different colour** to draw lines representing the **minimum** and **maximum** possible range of time that is missing between the deposition of rock units on either side of the structure labelled S2. </li>
<li> **Save** this result with a new filename that clearly identifies it as yours, eg. "JaneDoe-sketch2.png". </li>
<li> **Submit to Connect** as requested in the Lab 1 steps that follow the "Questions to answer". </li>
</ol>
