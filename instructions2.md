## Instructions for sketch 2 are very similar:

 * Add **your name** to the bottom left blank region.
 * Use a different colour to draw lines for your **interpretations of age ranges** for specimens in the figure. 
 * IN ADDITION - use a **different colour** to draw lines representing the **minimum** and **maximum** possible range of time that is missing between the deposition of rock units on either side of the structure labelled S2. 
 * **Save** this result with a new filename that clearly identifies it as yours, eg. "JaneDoe-sketch2.png". 
 * **Submit to Connect** as requested in the Lab 1 steps that follow the "Questions to answer".
